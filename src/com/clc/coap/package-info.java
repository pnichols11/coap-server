/**
 * <p>
 * Cotiviti Coap Server Example with threading.
 * <p>
 * <p>
 * <p> <b>Description: </b></p>
 * <p>
 *  This sample program demonstrates how to create a CoapServer and have it use threads to connect
 *  to connect and post inbound data to an MQTT topic.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Threads will be bound to inbound processes and to the MQTT topic. This application
 * assumes that you have an MQTT broker set up and that you can connect to it.
 * 
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * No MQTT broker is set up for this sample application, outside my own personal
 * domain. It is not publically accessible, sorry/
 * </p>
